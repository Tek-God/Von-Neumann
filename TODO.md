Mod To-Do:
-Update mod description to give idea of gameplay
-Update intro text
-Version indicator in-game?
-Tutorial button in top left?
-Disable player based items (armor, guns, etc)
-Unlock nightvision for godmode without armor when researched?
-Improve 'disallowed action' texts: e.g. "Thuro tried to pick up inserter" -> "Thuro tried to pick up inserter but that is not allowed, use robots!"
-Some way to 'pick up' a ghost when trying to pick up or craft an item? Super annoying to set ghost in toolbar for each item.
-More toolbars to deal with ghost on toolbar issue?
-Mark tree/rock for decon when trying to mine?!? Super cool!
-Maybe give player some basic decon BPs (tree/rock only, ground item only) as starter?
-Prevent player trying to ghost unique items: repaired lab, chest, assemblers, electricity generator
-When items are spilled, don't say player tried to pick them up?
-Scenario ends if main structure is destroyed?

Interesting notes:
-Once a roboport is placed, robots will try to service the area even before it has power (e.g. pick up decon marked items)
